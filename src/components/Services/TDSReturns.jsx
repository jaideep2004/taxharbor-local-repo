			{
				question: "Which ITR form is applicable for me?",
				answer:
					"The applicable ITR form depends on your sources of income. For salaried individuals with one house property, ITR-1 (Sahaj) is typically used. For individuals with business income or multiple properties, ITR-3 or ITR-4 may be applicable. Our experts will determine the correct form based on your specific situation.",
			},
			{
				question: "What documents do I need to provide for ITR filing?",
				answer:
					"Basic documents include Form 16 from your employer, Form 26AS (tax credit statement), bank statements, investment proofs for tax-saving deductions (such as 80C, 80D investments), home loan interest certificate (if applicable), and rent receipts if you claim HRA. For business income, profit and loss statements and balance sheets are also required.",
			},
			{
				question: "Is it mandatory to file an income tax return?",
				answer:
					"ITR filing is mandatory if your gross total income exceeds the basic exemption limit (currently ₹2.5 lakhs for individuals under 60 years). However, filing returns is advisable even if your income is below the threshold, as it creates an official income record, helps in loan applications, visa processing, and claiming tax refunds.",
			},
			{
				question: "What is the deadline for filing ITR?",
				answer:
					"The general deadline for filing ITR is July 31st each year for individuals. For businesses requiring audit, it's usually October 31st. These dates may be extended by the government in certain circumstances. Late filing is still possible with penalties until December 31st of the assessment year.",
			},
			{
				question: "How long does it take to process my tax return?",
				answer:
					"Once we receive all your documents, we typically process and file your return within 3-5 working days. After filing, the Income Tax Department usually processes returns within 20-45 days, after which any applicable refund is issued.",
			},
			{
				question: "What happens if I miss the ITR filing deadline?",
				answer:
					"If you miss the July 31st deadline, you can still file a belated return until December 31st of the assessment year with a late fee ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000 depending on your income level. However, certain benefits like carrying forward losses (except house property loss) may not be available with belated returns.",
			},
			{
				question: "Can I revise my ITR if I discover a mistake after filing?",
				answer:
					"Yes, if you have filed your return within the due date, you can file a revised return to correct any omission or mistake until the end of the assessment year or before completion of assessment, whichever is earlier.",
